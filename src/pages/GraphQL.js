[GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) is a *query language* for APIs. It enables declarative data fetching and thus ties in perfectly with React as a declarative framework for building user interfaces. GraphQL can either complement or entirely replace the usage of REST APIs.

The main difference between REST and GraphQL is that RESTful APIs have *multiple endpoints* that return *fixed data structures* whereas a GraphQL server only exposes a *single endpoint* and returns *flexible data structures*. This works because a client that needs data from the server also submits its precise data requirements in each request which allows the server to tailor the response exactly according to the clientâ€™s needs.

You can learn more about the differences between GraphQL and REST [here](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/1-graphql-is-the-better-rest/).
